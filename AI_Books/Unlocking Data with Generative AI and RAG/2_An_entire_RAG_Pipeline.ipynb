Understanding RAG: Basics and Principles#\n",
      "Modern day large language models (LLM) are impressive, but they have never seen your company’s private data (hopefully!). This means the ability of an LLM to help your company fully utilize its own data is very limited. This very large barrier has given rise to the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where you are using the power and capabilities of the LLM, but combining it with the knowledge and data contained within your company’s internal data repositories. This is the primary motivation for using RAG, to make new data available to the LLM and significantly increase the value you can extract from that data. Beyond internal data, it is also useful in cases where the LLM has not been trained on the data, even if it is public, like the most recent research papers or articles about a topic that is strategic to your company. In both cases, we are talking about data that was not present during the training of the LLM. You can have the latest LLM trained on the most tokens ever, exceeding 10 trillion, but if that data was not present for the training, then the LLM will be at a disadvantage to help you reach your full productivity. Ultimately, this highlights the fact that for most organizations, connecting to data an LLM is not yet familiar with is a central need for them to fully utilize that LLM. RAG is the most popular paradigm for doing this. This book focuses on showing you how to set up a RAG application with your data, as well as how to get the most out of it in various situations. I intend to give you an in-depth understanding of RAG and its importance in leveraging LLM within the context of a company's private or specific data needs. Advantages of RAG#\n",
      "Potential advantages of using RAG include improved accuracy and relevance, customization, flexibility, and expanding the model’s knowledge beyond the training data. Here is each advantage more thoroughly explored:\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved Accuracy and Relevance: RAG can significantly enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses that are generated by large language models (LLMs). RAG fetches and incorporates specific information from a database or dataset, typically in real time, and ensures that the output is based on both the model’s pre-existing knowledge and the most current and relevant data that you are providing directly. Customization and Flexibility: RAG can customize its responses based on your domain specific needs. By integrating a company's internal databases into the model's response generation process, RAG allows for outputs that are tailored to the unique context and requirements of the business. This level of customization is invaluable for creating personalized experiences and for applications requiring a high degree of specificity and detail. Expanding Model Knowledge Beyond Training Data: LLMs are limited by the scope of their training data. RAG overcomes this limitation by enabling models to access and utilize information that was not included in their initial training sets. This effectively expands the knowledge base of the model without the need for retraining, making LLMs more versatile and adaptable to new domains or rapidly evolving topics. Limitations of RAG#\n",
      "But there are some limitations to using RAG, which include dependency on the quality of the internal data, computational overhead, more complex integrations, and the potential for information overload. Dependency on Data Quality: \n",
      "When talking about how data can impact an AI model, the saying in data science circles is “garbage in, garbage out.”  Meaning, if you give a model bad data, it will give you bad results. RAG is no different. The effectiveness of RAG is directly tied to the quality of the data it retrieves. If the underlying database or dataset contains outdated, biased, or inaccurate information, the outputs generated by RAG will likely suffer from the same issues. Need for Data Manipulation and Cleaning:\n",
      "Data in the recesses of the company often has a lot of value to it, but it is not often in good, accessible shape. For example, data from PDF-based customer statements needs a lot of massaging to get into a format that can be useful to a RAG pipeline. Computational Overhead: \n",
      "A RAG pipeline introduces a host of new computational steps into the response generation process, including data retrieval, processing, and integration. LLMs are getting faster every day, but even the fastest response can be more than a second, and some can take several seconds. If you combine that with other data processing steps, and possibly multiple LLM calls, the result can be a very significant increase in the time it takes to receive a response. This all leads to increased computational overhead, affecting the efficiency and scalability of the entire system. As with any other IT initiative, an organization must balance the benefits of enhanced accuracy and customization against the resource requirements and potential latency introduced by these additional processes. Data Storage Explosion: Complexity in Integration and Maintenance: \n",
      "Traditionally, your data resides in a data source which is queried in various ways to be made available to your internal and external systems. But with RAG, your data resides in multiple forms and locations, such as vectors in a vector database, that represent the same data, but in a different format. Add in the complexity of connecting these various data sources to LLMs and relevant technical mechanisms like vector searches, and you have a significant increase in complexity. This increased complexity can be resource-intensive.' metadata={'source': 'https://kbourne.github.io/chapter1.html'}\n"

      "[Document(metadata={'source': 'https://kbourne.github.io/chapter1.html'}, page_content='Can you imagine what you could do with all of the benefits mentioned above, but combined with all of the data within your company, about everything your company has ever done, about your customers and all of their interactions, or about all of your products and services combined with a knowledge of what a specific customer’s needs are? You do not have to imagine it, that is what RAG does! Even smaller companies are not able to access much of their internal data resources very effectively. Larger companies are swimming in petabytes of data that is not readily accessible or is not being fully utilized. Prior to RAG, most of the services you saw that connected customers or employees with the data resources of the company were really just scratching the surface of what is possible compared to if they could access ALL of the data in the company. With the advent of RAG and generative AI in general, corporations are on the precipice of something really, really big. Comparing RAG with Model Fine-Tuning#\\nEstablished Large Language Models (LLM), what we call the foundation models, can learn in two ways:\\n Fine-tuning - With fine-tuning, you are adjusting the weights and/or biases that define the model\\'s intelligence based on new training data. This directly impacts the model, permanently changing how it will interact with new inputs. Input/Prompts - This is where you actually \"use\" the model, using the prompt/input to introduce new knowledge that the LLM can act upon. Why not use fine-tuning in all situations?'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://kbourne.github.io/chapter1.html'}, page_content='Fine-tuning, on the other hand, is more suitable for teaching the model specialized tasks or adapting it to a specific domain. Keep in mind the limitations of context window sizes and the potential for overfitting when fine-tuning on a specific dataset. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://kbourne.github.io/chapter1.html'}, page_content='Maintaining this integration over time, especially as data sources evolve or expand, adds even more complexity and cost. Organizations need to invest in technical expertise and infrastructure to effectively leverage RAG capabilities while accounting for the rapid increase in complexities these systems bring with them. Potential for Information Overload: \\nIt is very possible for RAG-based systems to pull in too much information. It is just as important to implement mechanisms to address this issue as it is to handle times when not enough relevant information is found. Determining the relevance and importance of retrieved information to be included in the final output requires sophisticated filtering and ranking mechanisms. Without these, the quality of the generated content could be compromised by an excess of unnecessary or marginally relevant details. RAG Vocabulary#\\nNow is as good a time as any to review some vocabulary that should help you get familiar with the various concepts in RAG. This is not an exhaustive list, but understanding these core concepts should help you understand everything else we teach you about RAG in a more effective way:\\nLarge Language Model (LLM)\\nMost of this book will deal with LLMs. LLMs are generative AI technologies that focus on generating text.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://kbourne.github.io/chapter1.html'}, page_content='But there are many other skills these foundation models can be fine-tuned for. LLaMA 2 is a foundation model and because it is open source, there are many spin offs that have been fine-tuned for many applications, such as medical research and conversation. Most of the models we talk about are very close to foundation models, but will likely be fine-tuned for at least conversational capabilities. Parameters and Biases\\nWe are trying to keep our focus on RAG primarily in this book, but it will be helpful for you to understand what parameters and biases are in LLM models. In machine learning models in general, including LLMs, parameters and biases are the learnable variables that the model adjusts during the training process to improve its performance on a given task. Parameters are the weights associated with the connections between neurons in the model\\'s architecture. These weights determine the strength and importance of each connection and are updated during training to minimize the difference between the model\\'s predictions and the expected outputs. Biases, on the other hand, are additional values added to the weighted sum of inputs at each neuron. They help the model learn an offset or shift in the data, allowing for more flexibility in fitting the training data. Together, parameters and biases form the learnable components of the model that are fine-tuned using the training data to improve the model\\'s performance on specific tasks or domains. Understanding parameters and biases is important in the context of RAG because the process of training and fine-tuning LLMs involves adjusting these variables. I mention foundation models, where the initial training involves setting these parameters and biases. However, fine-tuning an LLM by further adjusting its parameters and biases can significantly impact its performance and behavior within a RAG pipeline. By adapting the model to specific domains, writing styles, or tasks, you can improve the accuracy and relevance of the LLM\\'s responses when it is used to generate output based on the retrieved information. This, in turn, can lead to better overall performance of the RAG system in terms of providing more useful and context-appropriate answers to user queries. Therefore, choosing an LLM that is properly fine-tuned for your domain, or applying the fine-tuning yourself, is crucial for optimizing the most important element of your RAG pipeline. Prompting, Prompt Design, Prompt Engineering\\nThese terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but technically, while they all have to do with prompting, they do have fairly different meanings. Prompting is the act of sending a query or “prompt” into an LLM. Prompt design refers to the strategy you take to “design” the prompt you will send to the LLM. There are many different prompt design strategies that work in different scenarios, and we will review many of these in Chapter 13, Utilizing Prompt Engineering to Improve RAG Efforts. We will also review prompt engineering in chapter 13. Prompt engineering focuses more on the technical aspects surrounding the prompt that you use to improve the outputs from the LLM. For example, you may break up a complex query into two or three different LLM interactions, “engineering” it better to achieve superior results. Inference\\nWe will use the term ‘inference’ from time to time. Generally, this refers to the process of the LLM generating outputs or predictions based on given inputs using a pre-trained language model. But a key aspect of inference is that with an LLM, particularly with the cloud-based providers, you are charged based on the inference. Context Window\\nA context window, in the context of LLMs, refers to the maximum number of tokens (words, subwords, or characters) that the model can process as input or generate as output in a single pass. It determines the amount of text the model can \"see\" or \"attend to\" at once when making predictions or generating responses. The context window size is a key parameter of the model architecture and is typically fixed during model training. It directly relates to the input size of the model, as it sets an upper limit on the number of tokens that can be fed into the model at a time. For example, if a model has a context window size of 4,096 tokens, it means that the model can process and generate sequences of up to 4,096 tokens. When processing longer texts, such as documents or conversations, the input needs to be divided into smaller segments that fit within the context window. This is often done using techniques like sliding windows or truncation. The size of the context window has implications for the model\\'s ability to understand and maintain long-range dependencies and context. Models with larger context windows can capture and utilize more contextual information when generating responses, which can lead to more coherent and contextually relevant outputs. However, increasing the context window size also increases the computational resources required to train and run the model. In the context of RAG, the context window size is particularly important because it determines how much information from the retrieved documents can be effectively utilized by the model when generating the final response. Recent advancements in language models have led to the development of models with significantly larger context windows, enabling them to process and retain more information from the retrieved sources. Fine-Tuning in 2 Flavors: Full Model Fine Tuning (FMFT) and Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)\\nFull model fine-tuning (FMFT) is where you take a foundation model and train it further to gain new capabilities. You could simply give it new knowledge for a specific domain, or you could give it a skill, like being a conversational chat-bot. FMFT updates all of the parameters and biases in the model. PEFT is a type of fine-tuning, where you focus only on specific parts of the parameters or biases when you fine-tune the model, but with a similar goal as general fine-tuning. The latest research in this area shows that you can achieve similar results to FMFT with far less cost, time commitment, and data. While this book is not focused on fine-tuning, it is a very valid strategy to try to use a model fine-tuned with your own data to give it more knowledge from your domain or to give it more of “voice” from your domain. For example, you could train it to talk more like a scientist than a generic foundation model, if using this in a scientific field.')]\n"
